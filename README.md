## 🗂️ Repository Structure

The repository is divided into main folders based on the learning sequence.  
More folders will be added as new topics are introduced.

### 📌 Current Main Folders

- 🐍 **Python**  
- 📦 **Libraries**  
- 🤖 **Machine Learning**  
- 🧠 **Deep Learning**  
- 🗣️ **NLP (Natural Language Processing)**

## 🏗️ Folder Organization (Common Structure)


Each **main folder** follows the same structure:

~~~
<Main Folder>/
├── 1_Practice/
└── 2_Professional_Projects/
~~~
